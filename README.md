## Introduction

I chose this title to capture my idea of exploring and sharing the modern JavaScript develpment for Cloud. I will explore various different things using JavaScript and deploy them to cloud (in this case Azure).

**01-Installing Visual Studio Code for Node.js Development**

Visual Studio Code is the ultimate editor for JavaScript development. I would like to demonstrate how to set it up and make it ready for the development. In later part of another video, I will demonstrate about various different productivity tips for Visual Studio code and explore some essential Extensions.

**02-Installing Node, NPM and building first application **

In a fresh OS installing Node.js which also installs NPM. NPM is Node Package Manager. This helps you bring the libraries using single command. This enables us to keep our code clean without really shipping the library files which can be significant. Using `package.json` the dependencies are mentioned and once we have the `package.json` we can run `npm install` to bring all the libraries required. After this we will also test if the Node and NPM is working.
